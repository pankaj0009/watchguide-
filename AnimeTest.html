            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Naruto Uzumaki, a hyperactive and knuckle-headed ninja, lives in Konohagakure, 
                the Hidden Leaf village. Moments prior to his birth, a huge demon known as the Kyuubi, the Nine-tailed
                 Fox, attacked Konohagakure and wreaked havoc. In order to put an end to the Kyuubi's rampage, 
                 the leader of the village, the 4th Hokage, sacrificed his life and sealed the monstrous beast 
                 inside the newborn Naruto. 

                Shunned because of the presence of the Kyuubi inside him, Naruto struggles to find his place in
                 the village. He strives to become the Hokage of Konohagakure, and he meets many friends and

            <p><strong>Review: </strong>
                Naruto is an amazing anime. It builds up its characters. The main protagonist is seen as a
                 knucleheaded ninja but has depth. His backstory is sad and shows why he wants to achieve his
                  goal. Shippuden is epic but the war arc is lacks proper writing.  However the other arcs are great and the fights are one of the best in all of anime. Sasuke vs Itachi to Naruto vs Pain to Naruto vs Sasuke. Strategic fights like Shikamaru vs Hidan are amazing in their own right

           <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Gol D. Roger was known as the Pirate King, the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and death of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the location of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece (which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame), and quite possibly the most coveted of titles for the person who found it, the title of the Pirate King.

                        Enter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy that defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate who ransacks villages for fun, Luffy’s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder; the thought of an exciting adventure and meeting new and intriguing people, along with finding One Piece, are his reasons of becoming a pirate. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach One Piece. </p>

                <p><strong>Review: </strong>
                    In my personal opinion, One Piece is one of those animes that is easy to love and is just as easy to hate. Funnily enough, those who love One Piece love it for exactly the same reasons that others hate it; the extreme characters, zany abilities, and classic artstyle all contribute to both sides. This review's goal is neither to covince you to love One Piece, nor is it the opposite. The review merely expresses my own personal views of the series.

                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A shinigami, as a god of death, can kill any person—provided they see their victim's face and write their victim's name in a notebook called a Death Note. One day, Ryuk, bored by the shinigami lifestyle and interested in seeing how a human would use a Death Note, drops one into the human realm.

                            High school student and prodigy Light Yagami stumbles upon the Death Note and—since he deplores the state of the world—tests the deadly notebook by writing a criminal's name in it. When the criminal dies immediately following his experiment with the Death Note, Light is greatly surprised and quickly recognizes how devastating the power that has fallen into his hands could be. 
                            
                            With this divine capability, Light decides to extinguish all criminals in order to build a new world where crime does not exist and people worship him as a god. Police, however, quickly discover that a serial killer is targeting criminals and, consequently, try to apprehend the culprit. To do this, the Japanese investigators count on the assistance of the best detective in the world: a young and eccentric man known only by the name of L. </p>

                This show is amazing! The entire show I was torn between if I was rooting for Light or against him, the ending especially is probably one of the best endings to anything I've ever seen because you're just confused and don't know what to think and I'll leave it to that.

            <p><strong>Review: </strong>
                At first glance, this anime doesn't appear to be anything different than other shounen animes. However, if one is to take the time to watch this anime through even a few arcs, they will realize that it's comparable to Gintama in the fact that it can be an episodic anime that can make the reader laugh, cry, and shout for victory. Any loose ends that seem left open early in the story are left there on purpose! These will become important as the story progresses, and do not worry about being left in the dark, because there will be back-stories when necessary. This is not an anime where the arc will pause for practically a season long back story
                <br><strong> anime that anyone loving action and comedy should watch!</strong>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The seemingly ordinary and unimpressive Saitama has a rather unique hobby: being a hero. In order to pursue his childhood dream, he trained relentlessly for three years—and lost all of his hair in the process. Now, Saitama is incredibly powerful, so much so that no enemy is able to defeat him in battle. In fact, all it takes to defeat evildoers with just one punch has led to an unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill of battling and has become quite bored.

    This all changes with the arrival of Genos, a 19-year-old cyborg, who wishes to be Saitama's disciple after seeing what he is capable of. Genos proposes that the two join the Hero Association in order to become certified heroes that will be recognized for their positive contributions to society, and Saitama, shocked that no one knows who he is, quickly agrees. And thus begins the story of One Punch Man, an action-comedy that follows an eccentric individual who longs to fight strong enemies that can hopefully give him the excitement he once felt and just maybe, he'll become popular in the process.</p>

<p><strong>Review: </strong>
    One Punch Man is an anime dedicated for those, including myself, who value more on superb action animation-based quality while putting story-wise and characters on the least priority. Because they focus so much on its animation and art wise, it can lead to double-edge sword for some people So in order not to be slightly betrayed by this, I recommend people to shift their mode of thinking from being too serious to become "why so serious".

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> 
    Ever since he was a child, fifteen-year-old Souma Yukihira has helped his father by working as the sous chef in the restaurant his father runs and owns. Throughout the years, Souma developed a passion for entertaining his customers with his creative, skilled, and daring culinary creations. His dream is to someday own his family's restaurant as its head chef.
 Yet when his father suddenly decides to close the restaurant to test his cooking abilities in restaurants around the world, he sends Souma to Tootsuki Culinary Academy, an elite cooking school where only 10 percent of the students graduate. The institution is famous for its "Shokugeki" or "food wars," where students face off in intense, high-stakes cooking showdowns.
     As Souma and his new schoolmates struggle to survive the extreme lifestyle of Tootsuki, more and greater challenges await him, putting his years of learning under his father to the test.

<p><strong>Review: </strong>
    2 tablespoons of comedy<br>
    1 teaspoon of fan service<br>
    1 cup of flawless character design<br>
    a dash of feeling diabetic and obese<br>
    a hint of romance<br>
    and 4 million cups of wishing this could happen to me<br>
    This anime is amazing.

                <p><strong>Summary:</strong> 
                    Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by giants. Giants are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of giants.
Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a giant in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a super giant that appears out of thin air. As the smaller giants flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single giant and take revenge for all of mankind.

                <p><strong>Review: </strong>
                    Shingeki no Kyojin, or some might call it Attack on titan brings us an outstanding story line that is original and very engaging, that compels the viewer to keep on watching every week, and sitting with your jaw hanging for a while after the massive cliffhanger at almost every episode
                    Simply just amazing must watch for any anime watcher. Almost everything about this show is top notch level. Music is great, animation is great, plot is great, entertainment level is high, characters could do with a bit more development but still great.

<p><strong>Review: </strong>
    I will say though that this is one of those special series. This is a series that comes along once in a blue moon. It's very rare that you come across a comedy of all things that will move you to tears and then turn around on a dime to make you fall over laughing.

    This isn't a series that shouldn't stay on anyone's 'to be watched' list for very long; instead it should be bumped to the top of your queue and viewed post haste.

<p><strong>Review: </strong>
    Even for those who have never seen the Old School DragonBall, this series is nothing short of a treat. Perfect "starter" for people looking into this breed of animation; A stand alone epic that will undoubtedly immerse ANYONE into a mystical, fantastic world of magic, mayhem, and everything in between extending to realms far beyond it's spunky origin. With rich increscent stories coupled with heart warming, out of this WORLD characters, this season of the action packed anime will leave you wanting more and more
